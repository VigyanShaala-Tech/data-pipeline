Project : Kalpana Data Pipeline Code

Welcome to the Kalpana Data Pipeline! This repository contains the necessary files and folders to help you manage and process 
data from various sources. The primary purpose of this tool is to clean and transform data from sources like graphs, documents, etc., and store it 
in a MySQL database while also generating Excel files for further analysis and reporting.

Folder Structure

scripts: This folder contains the codebase for the Kalpana Incubator Sept- Dec 2023 Batch. It is responsible for processing and cleaning 
	the data from various sources and managing the data pipeline. The code is well commented so anyone can easily understand.
output: In this folder, you will find the output Excel files generated by the tool. These Excel files are the result of the data remapping 
	process and can be used for analysis and reporting.

data_files: The Data Files folder contains the raw data from various sources, such as graphs and documents, which need to be processed. 
	This data serves as the input for the data cleaning and remapping process.

How it Works
The Kalpana Incubator Data Remapping Tool follows these key steps:

	1) Data Ingestion: Raw data from various sources is placed in the "Data Files" folder.

	2) Data Cleaning: The code in the "scripts" folder processes and cleans the raw data, ensuring it is ready for analysis and storage.

	3) Data Storage: The cleaned data is stored in a MySQL database for further use.

	4) Output Generation: The tool generates Excel files containing the cleaned data and places them in the "Output" folder.

Getting Started
To start using the Data Pipeline, follow these steps:

Place your raw data files in the "Data Files" folder.

	1) Execute the code in the "scripts" folder to process and clean the data.

	2) Retrieve the cleaned data from the MySQL database for analysis.

	3) Find the generated Excel files in the "Output" folder for reporting and sharing.

Additional Information
	1) Please ensure you have the necessary dependencies and database connection information configured in the code before running it like various libaries requried.

	2) This tool is designed to streamline the data remapping process and make it more efficient for the Data operation team.
